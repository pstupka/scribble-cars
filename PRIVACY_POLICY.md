**Children’s Privacy**

I follow the principles of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"), a U.S. law designed to protect the online privacy of children, in my Apps that are directed to children. If you would like to learn more about COPPA, you can refer to the "Children's Privacy" section of the Federal Trade Commission's website.

I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. I encourage all children to never submit any personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services. If I was to collect and store personal information from children, I would obtain the consent of a parent or legal guardian before such collection, unless the collection of information falls within an exception that is permitted under COPPA. In my Apps directed to children users, I may collect information which includes persistent identifiers such as a device identifier ("device ID") or an Internet Protocol address ("IP address"). This information is collected solely for the purpose of providing functionality and support for internal operations and optimizing users' experience.

I encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child has provided personally identifiable information to me through the Application and/or Services, please contact me. You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing of your personally identifiable information in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).
